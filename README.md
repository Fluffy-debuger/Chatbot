# Chatbot
This project is a full-stack AI chatbot application built with **FastAPI** and **React** that integrates with the **CallMissed API**. It provides three core capabilities:

- AI Chat
- Vision (Image + Question)
- Image Generation

The application also includes user authentication using Clerk and conversation persistence using Supabase (PostgreSQL).

# CallMissed API

This project uses the CallMissed API.

Documentation:

https://docs.callmissed.com

Create a free API key from the dashboard and place it inside the backend `.env` file.

---

# Error Handling

The backend handles:

- Missing request fields
- Invalid image uploads
- Invalid request formats
- CallMissed API failures
- HTTP 429 (quota exceeded)
- Authentication failures

---


# Trade-offs

To keep the project focused on the assignment requirements:

- FastAPI was used for the backend.
- React was used for the frontend.
- Clerk was used for authentication.
- Supabase was used for conversation persistence.
- Docker and automated tests were not implemented due to time constraints.

---

# Future Improvements

- Request rate limiting
- Conversation search
- Conversation export
- Better markdown rendering
- Image upload progress

---

# AI Usage

AI tools were used for:

- Understanding the CallMissed API documentation
- Reviewing FastAPI implementation
- Debugging integration issues
- Improving documentation

All implementation, testing, debugging, integration, and project structure were completed manually.
